The app will use the Resource Description Framework triplets to map the relation between business entities, structure this information in a sustainable way and then retrieve it on demand in the right context. Various technologies such as SAP HANA Cloud, Anthropic Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT4o and of course SAP's AI Core and AI Launchpad will be leveraged to realize this application.

In this project, the source system was a HANA database with poorly performing views, millions of records per day, and a business expectation for real-time reporting. The task was clear: not just lift and shift, but completely redesign the model while delivering a major performance improvement.\n\nIn this session, I will walk you through how we tackled it:\n\nReplacing poorly performing HANA views with a leaner model in Datasphere\n\nHandling millions of records per day efficiently with robust processing strategies\n\nDetecting duplicates, tracking deletions, and ensuring reliable delta logic\n\nApplying performance optimizations and data structures to enable near real-time reporting\n\nThe result: a scalable, future-proof model that not only migrated successfully but also delivered a significant performance boost.\n\nWhether you are preparing for a similar migration or simply want to learn how to get the most out of Datasphere for large-scale data volumes, this session will share practical tips, common pitfalls to avoid, and insights straight from the field.","id":"id-1759481705811-689","presentationLinks":[],"speakers":[{"bio":"","company":"","email":"martijn.plugge@interdobs.nl","firstName":"Martijn","hasPhoto":false,"lastName":"Plugge"}],"title":"From SAP BW to Datasphere: High-Volume Migration with a Performance Boost","type":"presentation_bi"},{"description":"This presentation will be about the lessons learned \u0026amp; best practices of using replication flows at the Alliander greenfield datasphere project.\nIt will consist of about 15 minutes of theory, 10 minutes of (live) demonstration and 5 minutes of QA.","id":"id-1759774280828-402","presentationLinks":[],"speakers":[{"bio":"","company":"McCoy \u0026amp; Partners B.V.","email":"joran.de.vries@mccoy-partners.com","firstName":"Joran","hasPhoto":false,"lastName":"de Vries"}],"title":"Best practices \u0026amp; Lessons learned using replication flows in datasphere","type":"presentation_bi"},{"description":"After a few quiet years, the SAP Data and Analytics TechEd recap has roared back to life! \n\nAt SAP TechEd, new announcements and bold roadmaps signal a clear message: innovation in data is not only alive, it’s accelerating.

While this may seem straightforward, it introduces serious risks: leaked credentials, lack of traceability, and limited control over who accesses what.\n\nIn this session, we’ll explore how Principal Propagation transforms SAP integrations by eliminating the need to share credentials. You’ll learn how it enables secure, user- and application-level traceability in the SAP backend, supports last-mile security checks, and allows for customized authorizations.
