In this project, the source system was a HANA database with poorly performing views, millions of records per day, and a business expectation for real-time reporting. The task was clear: not just lift and shift, but completely redesign the model while delivering a major performance improvement.\n\nIn this session, I will walk you through how we tackled it:\n- Replacing poorly performing HANA views with a leaner model in Datasphere\n- Handling millions of records per day efficiently with robust processing strategies\n- Detecting duplicates, tracking deletions, and ensuring reliable delta logic\n- Applying performance optimizations and data structures to enable near real-time reporting\n- The result: a scalable, future-proof model that not only migrated successfully but also delivered a significant performance boost.\n\nWhether you are preparing for a similar migration or simply want to learn how to get the most out of Datasphere for large-scale data volumes, this session will share practical tips, common pitfalls to avoid, and insights straight from the field.","endTime":"11:55","id":"id-1759481705811-689","location":"universe","presentationLinks":[],"speakers":[{"bio":"","company":"","email":"martijn.plugge@interdobs.nl","firstName":"Martijn","hasPhoto":false,"lastName":"Plugge"}],"startTime":"11:25","title":"From SAP BW to Datasphere: High-Volume Migration with a Performance Boost","type":"presentation_bi"},{"description":"This presentation will be about the lessons learned \u0026amp; best practices of using replication flows at the Alliander greenfield datasphere project.\nIt will consist of about 15 minutes of theory, 10 minutes of (live) demonstration and 5 minutes of QA.","endTime":"13:35","id":"id-1759774280828-402","location":"universe","presentationLinks":[],"speakers":[{"bio":"","company":"McCoy \u0026amp; Partners B.V.","email":"joran.de.vries@mccoy-partners.com","firstName":"Joran","hasPhoto":false,"lastName":"de Vries"}],"startTime":"13:00","title":"Best practices \u0026amp; Lessons learned using replication flows in datasphere","type":"presentation_bi"},{"description":"After a few quiet years, the SAP Data and Analytics TechEd recap has roared back to life! \n\nAt SAP TechEd, new announcements and bold roadmaps signal a clear message: innovation in data is not only alive, it’s accelerating.
